A list of stuff I've read in the last year, along with short summaries and some commentary.

## _Debt: The First 5,000 Years_ by David Graeber (2011)

**This book is**: a 5,000-year archaeology of obligation, showing how debt, not money, is the real operating system of societies.

Graeber’s core claim: money isn’t the root; obligation is.
Human coordination started with soft credit webs, “you owe me / i owe you.”
The canonical econ story (barter → money → credit) is backwards; the actual sequence is more like credit → hierarchy → violence → money → markets.
That inversion matters because it reframes markets as political artifacts, not primordial equilibria.

Main takeaways:

- Debt/obligation, rather than money/barter, is the foundational structure of economies.
- Money isn't a thing that was invented. It's a unit like time and weight that emerged from social relationships, as old as human civilization.
- The idea of a "barter economy" as a precursor to money is a myth.
- Markets existed long before capitalism; capitalism = markets + enforceable debt + institutionalized extraction.
- Debt is a social construct, not a natural law, and has been used a governance technology throughout history — a way to formalize asymmetry and turn social fuzz into enforceable hierarchy.
- The moralizing of debt as a personal guilt/failure is a recent phenomenon.
- History runs on cycles: soft relational credit ↔ hard money enforced by states and armies.
- Periodic debt cancellations (jubilees) were normal for millennia; what’s weird is the modern aversion to reset ledgers in the face of systemic fragility.
- You could view the Crypto/DeFi movement as opting out of Graeber's 'soft credit' cycle (which they view as coercive state fiat) by bootstrapping a parallel 'hard money' regime (code-as-law) that runs without political trust.

## _The Skill Code: How to Save Human Ability in an Age of Intelligent Machines_ by Matt Beane (2024)

**This book is**: a contemporary anatomy of how human skill forms — and how intelligent machines are quietly hollowing out the apprenticeship loops that make real ability possible.

The gist: skill-building isn’t just doing things harder or smarter; it’s about embedding novices in relational systems where they’re pushed, immersed, and connected.
Machines threaten that system by stripping novices out, optimizing productivity but eroding the apprenticeship architecture.

Main takeaways:

- Skill is built via three C's: challenge (tasks near but above your edge), complexity (rich context, not just deconstructed steps), connection (trust, mentorship, expert-novice relationship).
- The expert-novice bond is ancient and foundational; losing it means losing the scaffold of reliable ability.
- Intelligent machines often sever novices from experts (expert does more, novice does less), which thwarts skill accumulation.
- “Shadow learning” emerges: people hack their way around broken systems to gain skill anyway.
- Tech isn’t the villain per se; the design and deployment of tech matters. Tech can augment the three C's if structured correctly.
- To preserve human ability we need to redesign work systems so they re-embed novices, expose them to challenge/complexity, and maintain connection — especially as AI and robots scale.
- You could say that AI tools like Copilot create a new, shallow form of "shadow learning"—hacking the prompt—which risks replacing the "challenge" and "complexity" C's with mere AI-wrangling, hollowing out the skill from a different vector.

## _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed_ by Lori Gottlieb (2019)

**This book is**: a dual-perspective memoir of therapist and patient, showing how humans edit their own lives and that therapy mostly works by destabilizing the stories we use to avoid seeing ourselves.

Main takeaways:

- What someone _presents_ (the breakup, the job crisis) is rarely the problem. The roots are deeper: fear, mortality, isolation.
- Therapy is a structured environment where someone won’t collude with your self-deceptions — a controlled demolition of your favorite narratives.
- The stories we tell ourselves protect us, but also imprison us; progress begins when we loosen the grip of those narratives.
- Vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s the signal that a new story is being written, the one beyond shame, pretense, and guilt.
- Change is less about major leaps and more about hundreds of tiny, almost-imperceptible steps, over time.
- The therapist–patient dual POV mirrors any good meta-system: observer and observed co-evolve, and the system learns by making its own internals visible.
