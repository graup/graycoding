> I'm a junior software engineer from Italy and I'm interested in working in Korea.
> I've heard that the tech industry there is growing rapidly and that there are a lot of opportunities for software engineers.
> However, I'm not sure how to go about finding a job in Korea as a foreigner. Can you give me some advice on how to get started?

Having lived and worked in Korea for almost a decade, many people have asked me for advice on how to find a job in Korea as a foreign software engineer.

Here are some tips to help you get started:

## 1. Understand the demand

Korea has a booming tech sector. Many startups are constantly looking for talented software engineers to join their teams.
Venture funding is very active, and the government is investing heavily in tech and innovation.

However, competition is fierce. Korea as a whole is facing the issue of an over-educated workforce,
and there is no shortage of average junior software engineers in the country.
Everything else being equal, hiring locals is way easier for Korean companies, thanks to no visa issues and potential language barriers.

What does this mean for you? You'll really need to stand out from the crowd to land a job in Korea as a foreigner.

## 2. Understand your worth

As a foreign software engineer, you potentially bring a unique perspective and skill set to the table.

Make sure to highlight your experience, skills, and any other relevant qualifications that set you apart from other candidates.

Broaden the way you advertise yourself.
Experience of working in different countries, insights into global markets, and a diverse network might not seem relevant to you for a software engineering job, but they can be a huge benefit for a company looking to expand globally.

## 3. Understand the hiring process

Understanding the process form the employer's point of view is crucial.

This is roughly the process I have seen at many Korean companies:

1. **Job advertisement**

   Good job advertisements include a clear job description, requirements, and benefits.
   For you that means you should analyze the job ad carefully to understand what the company is looking for and tailor your application accordingly.

2. **Document screening**

   Once you submit your tailored application, someone from HR or the hiring team will review it.
   Depending on the number of applications they receive, they might only spend a few seconds on each one, trying to answer the question if the candidate fits the role at all.
   For you that means the relevance of your experience and skills should be immediately clear.

   If your application fits the role, the screening person might spend another minute on it.
   Now they try to judge if there's anything exceptional in the profile, compared to other applicants for the same position.
   Relevant work experience or projects and unique skills can help you stand out here.

   If you pass the document check, your application will be marked as "accepted" and goes into a new pile from which candidates are chosen to be invited to interviews.

3. **Interviews**

   Honestly, if you made it this far and your skills actually match what they are looking for and you can present yourself well, you have a good chance of getting the job.
   Startups don't want to waste time on too many interview rounds, and they are usually looking for someone who can start working as soon as possible.
   They'll only invite a handful of candidates at a time, so if you're invited, you're in a good position.

4. **Visa process**

   If you do not already have a visa, the company will help you with the visa process.

   It's not that complicated or expensive, but it requires someone from HR to work through with you.
   They need to submit some forms about why they need to hire a foreigner. The process can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks.

## 4. Build a strong portfolio

In order to stand out to potential employers in Korea, you'll need to have a strong portfolio that showcases your skills and experience.

Make sure to include examples of your work, such as code samples, projects you've worked on, and any other relevant experience you have.

However, please remember: less is more.

## 5. Skill up

One of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of finding a job in Korea as a foreign software engineer is to learn Korean.

While many tech companies in Korea use English as their primary language, knowing Korean will give you a significant advantage when it comes to communicating with your colleagues and clients.

## 6. Network

Networking is key when it comes to finding a job in Korea, especially as a foreigner.

Attend tech events, conferences, and meetups in Korea to meet other professionals in the industry and make connections that could lead to job opportunities.

In the online application process, you're just one of many applicants. One that may require visa assistance. Getting a foot in the door is hard.

Making a personal connection with someone at the company vastly improves your chances of getting the job.
