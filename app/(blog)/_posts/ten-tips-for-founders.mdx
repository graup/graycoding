Having worked as a product engineer for many years, I’ve had the opportunity to witness two startups scale from around 20 to 100 people.
Based on my experience, here’s some advice–in no particular order–for future CEOs, CTOs, PMs, and engineers of small startups expecting to grow.
I’ve also included links to related articles and tweets I found inspiring.

1. **Don’t get bogged down by methodologies and hierarchy.**

   Fixed large teams working on the same thing for too long often become stagnant.
   [Keep teams small](https://basecamp.com/articles/how-we-structure-our-teams) or switch things up regularly.
   Make project teams own their projects end-to-end as much as possible if you don’t have dedicated PMs or EMs.

1. **Be meticulous about hiring.**

   Try to find a few [product-minded engineers](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/).
   Don’t hire too many juniors early on. If you do, get them to take ownership asap.
   While juniors bring fresh perspectives and energy, they need time to grow and communicate effectively.
   In early stages, 1 senior will have more impact than 2 juniors. Small teams of 1 experienced senior with 1 skilled junior can also be effective.

1. **Don’t let your codebase rot.**

   Your core features deserve continuous love and maintenance.
   Regularly refactor, update dependencies, and keep your code clean–before it’s too late and people start considering total rewrites because nobody wants to touch the legacy code anymore.
   Your systems must be able to grow along with your understanding of the domain and allow for upgrades.

1. **Write integration tests for critical paths.**

   All engineers learn that “you should write tests” but a lot of teams still don’t.
   At the very least, write integration tests for your critical use cases–[without testing implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details).
   Test edge cases like handling different user roles; things that can easily be forgotten in a few months where problems don’t surface easily.
   Without tests, things WILL break at some point, and then your engineers will be busy fixing things after release instead of working on the next feature.

1. **Make edge cases part of your specs.**

   Don’t let missing data, permissions hiccups, or unexpected errors sneak into your product.
   Have designers and engineers consider these explicitly; [plan and mitigate](https://twitter.com/carlvellotti/status/1640789675169161221).
   Too often, these are just afterthoughts. Don't design only for the "happy path".

1. **Don’t pay for enterprise software too early.**

   User behavior analytics is great, but if you only have a few hundred users, can you really justify paying thousands of dollars for something like Amplitude?
   Start simple and grow to more enterprisey services when you have the scale and can afford it.
   There’s a vendor out there for every company size—choose wisely and grow sustainably.

1. **Track important metrics, and do it well.**

   While intricate user metrics and A/B testing may not be worth your time yet, defining your [North Star metrics](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1454475114439917574?s=21) early is crucial.
   Track them in a reliable way and ensure your team understands [why these metrics matter](https://future.com/north-star-metrics).

1. **Hire user-centric, research-focused designers who question assumptions.**

   You want UI/UX designers with a strong research, prototyping, and testing mentality.
   A quick sketch visualizing an idea that can be shared with stakeholders and iterated on is far more valuable than pixel-perfect aesthetics.
   Look for designers that ask: “[How do we know this?](https://twitter.com/tranhelen/status/1640789943013502976)”

1. **Don’t assign tasks outside employees’ primary roles—unless it’s for skill development.**

   Are your sales reps and UX designers stretching themselves thin by working on marketing materials?
   While exploring branding can spark creativity and offer a refreshing change, it might be smarter to outsource these tasks to an agency initially and bring in dedicated experts as your budget allows.
   One exception: if someone is passionate about acquiring a new skill and you can afford to invest their time, let them dive in.
   Otherwise, it’s wiser to help them sharpening their expertise in their primary roles.

1. **Most importantly, never get too comfortable.**

   Do hard things. [Run towards fear](http://sophieshepherd.com/six-years/).
   As a leader, you represent the upper bound of your team's appetite.
   When leaders are not pushing themselves, their team won't either.
   When leaders become apathetic, so do their teams.
