Here is one possible definition for a _product_:

**A product is a packaged set of features that enable users to get a certain set of jobs done.**

It’s the toolbox that transforms problems into solutions, wrapped up with a user-friendly bow.

The packaging is your brand, marketing and sales strategy. Without it, it's just a tool.

There are two lenses through which you can view products: providing a _solution_ and providing an _experience_.

## Products as Solutions

Products typically achieve one of three outcomes in relation to improving a “thing” (a problem, workflow, job, etc.).
Think about which category the product you are building belongs to.

1. **Make It Possible for More People to Do the Thing**

   Example: Before word processors, only trained typists could produce professional documents. Now, thanks to user-friendly software, everyone from children to grandparents can write and format with ease.

2. **Increase the Power of Work**

   Example: A crane allows a construction worker to lift heavy materials that would be impossible to move manually. Similarly, software like Photoshop enables artists to create complex digital art that would be challenging with traditional mediums.

3. **Get Rid of the Entire Need for the Thing**

   Example: Central heating systems have eliminated the need for wood-burning stoves in each room. No more chopping wood or cleaning soot—the entire house stays cozy with just a turn of the thermostat. Similarly, smartphones have replaced a slew of devices like cameras, GPS units, and even flashlights, consolidating them into one handy gadget.

## Products as Experiences

Beyond just solving problems, great products are built to provide an experience. This encompasses how users interact with the product, the emotional response it evokes, and the overall satisfaction it delivers.

- **Turning Tasks into Joy: Delightful Interactions**

  A product that is enjoyable to use can turn mundane tasks into pleasant experiences. Think of how a sleek smartphone not only makes calls but also provides a satisfying tactile and visual experience.

- **Empowering Users: Feeling Capable and In Control**

  Good products make users feel capable and in control. For example, a well-designed photo editing app can make anyone feel like a professional photographer, even if their main subject is their breakfast.

- **Forming Bonds: Emotional Connections with Products**

  Some products create strong emotional bonds with users. Whether it’s a favorite pair of headphones that deliver crisp sound during your morning jog or a journal app that keeps your thoughts organized, these products become integral parts of daily life. They don’t just perform functions; they resonate on a personal level.

- **Aspirations and Identity: The Brand Experience**

  Products often carry the essence of a brand’s identity, contributing to the overall experience. Unboxing a new pair of Nike sneakers can make you feel like an athlete poised to break records. Branded products serve aspirations, tapping into users’ dreams and ambitions. The anticipation, the packaging, and the first interaction all add layers to the user’s experience, making them feel connected to something bigger than just the product itself.
