Many people have asked me for advice on how to find a job in Korea as a foreign software engineer.

Having spent five years at two Korean startups from 2018 to 2023,
I’ve experienced the hiring process firsthand many times.
In my later years, I also took part in recruiting myself.
I personally reviewed around 100 applications, interviewed 10 candidates, and successfully hired 5 junior-to-mid-level engineering positions.

I've compiled some actionable tips to help you embark on your journey.

## Understand the Demand

Korea has a booming tech sector. Many startups are constantly looking for talented software engineers to join their teams.
Venture funding is very active, and the government is investing heavily in tech and innovation.
Korea is a ultra fast-paced society, trends come and go, so if you're looking for a dynamic environment, Korea is a great place to be.

But here’s the catch: the competition is intense. Korea as a whole is facing an over-educated workforce,
and there is no shortage of decently average junior software engineers in the country.
Hiring locals is way easier for Korean companies, considering visa issues and potential language barriers,
so everything else being equal, you'll have a tough time competing with them.

What does this mean for you? You really need to stand out from the crowd to land a job in Korea as a foreigner.

## Understand Your Value

As a software engineer from abroad, what you can bring is a fresh perspective and diverse skill set.

Try expanding the way you advertise yourself.
Experience of working in different countries, insights into global markets, and a diverse network might not seem very relevant to you for a software engineering job,
but they can be a big plus for a company looking to expand globally, or at least appear to do so.

Make sure to highlight your experience, skills, and any other relevant qualifications that set you apart from other candidates.
Use everything you have to your advantage.

## Understand the Hiring Process

Understanding how Korean startups hire can help you optimize your application.

Here is a typical process I have seen at many Korean companies:

1. **Job Advertisement**

   Good job advertisements include a clear job description, requirements, and benefits.
   Carefully read job ads to understand what companies are looking for.
   Tailor your application accordingly.

2. **Document Screening**

   Once you submit your tailored application, someone from HR or the hiring team will review it.
   Depending on the number of applications they receive, they might only spend a few seconds on each one,
   quickly judging if the candidate fits the role at all. Make sure your resume clearly showcases your fit for the role at first glance.

   If your application grabs their attention, they’ll spend 1-2 minutes more to judge if there's anything exceptional in the profile,
   compared to other applicants for the same position.
   Relevant work experience or projects and unique skills can help you stand out here.

   If you pass the document check, your application is marked as "accepted" and goes into a new pile from which candidates are chosen to be invited to interviews.
   A typical job offer at our company (headcount 100) might receive 30-50 applicants, of which 10 might pass the document screening and 5 are invited to interviews.

3. **Interviews**

   Once you’ve made it this far, if your skills match what they’re looking for and you can present yourself well,
   you have a good chance of getting the job.
   Startups don't waste time on too many interview rounds and want new hires to get started asap.
   They'll only invite a handful of candidates at a time, so if you're invited, you're almost there.

4. **Visa Process**

   If you do not already have a visa, the company will help you with the visa process.
   This will probably be an E-7 visa (professional employment visa).

   This is not all that complicated or expensive, but it requires someone from HR to work through with you and can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks.
   The employer needs to submit some forms, e.g. about why they need to hire a foreigner.

   This also means that if you already have a visa, you are a much more attractive candidate. Highlight this fact in your application.

## Build a Strong Portfolio

So you understand that given the competition you need to stand out from the crowd, but how?
You'll need to have a strong portfolio that showcases your unique skills and experience.

In your resume or on your portfolio website, include a few examples of your work.
If you don't have any work experience yet, build some pet projects to show your skills.
But always remember: less is more.
Instead of cluttering your resume or website with everything you’ve ever worked on, focus on a select few projects that best highlight your abilities.
Don't just list things, contextualize. Why did you choose that project? What was technically challenging about it? What did you learn from it?

Implementing a simple game is a fun way to learn, but ultimately not very interesting for a company judging if you can solve problems for them (unless it's a game studio, of course).
Instead, build something that is meaningful to you personally.
You have an interest in music? Maybe build a chord progression generator.
You like cooking? How about a recipe recommendation engine?
Projects like these not only highlight your technical capabilities but also your creativity and problem-solving mindset, making your portfolio more engaging and memorable.

Another great way to get some practical experience of contributing to a software project is to participate in open-source projects.
Have a look at the GitHub repos of your favorite libraries and pick a small issue to fix.
Open source contributions show that you understand code bases, can communicate with other developers, and figure out how to contribute in a way that adapts to existing coding styles and project requirements.

As you gain professional experience, pet projects will quickly become less important
and your portfolio naturally evolves to emphasize your tangible achievements in the workplace.
Highlight your performance in previous roles, perhaps through detailed case studies or blog posts about technical challenges you’ve overcome.

## Learn Korean

One important thing you can do to increase your chances of finding a job in Korea as a foreign software engineer is to learn Korean.

While there are a few tech companies in Korea that use English as their primary language,
I'd say the majority of Koreans, even in IT, are not very comfortable with it.
Knowing even just a little bit of Korean will give you a significant advantage.

Learning the language also shows that you are serious about working in Korea and are willing to make an effort to integrate into the local culture.
In my experience, this is very much appreciated by your future colleagues.

## Network

Networking can be a huge boost when it comes to finding a job anywhere, and Korea is no exception.

Attend tech events, conferences, and meetups to meet other professionals in the industry and make connections that could lead to job opportunities.
There's no shortage of tech events in Seoul, you can easily attend one every week.

You can also try reaching out to current employees at companies you're interested in and ask them for informal coffee chats.
You will mostly get rejections, but it only takes one person to say yes.
Come with zero expectations, just be curious and ask questions.

In the faceless online application process, you're just one of many applicants. Even worse, one that may require visa assistance.
Getting a foot in the door as a foreigner is hard.
Personal connections can vastly improve your chances.

## Conclusion

Finding a job in Korea as a foreign software engineer is definitely possible
but it's certainly not the easiest place in the world.
There may be other countries with more demand or less hurdles in terms of visa and language.
Have you considered other tech hubs like Japan, Singapore, Estonia, and other [rising stars](https://dealroom.co/guides/top-tech-ecosystems#rising-stars)?

But if you do decide to go for it, Korea is a lovely place with a unique culture and tech scene that is keen to become more global.
Korean startups can be a lot of fun to work at.
Koreans are very welcoming and caring people.
I certainly had a very meaningful time there.
Good luck!
