Communication gaps between stakeholders are one of the biggest reasons for project failures.
In this article, I’ll explore how Domain Driven Design can bridge these gaps and bring clarity to the chaos.

This is based on
both the book [Learning Domain-Driven Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/) by Vlad Khononov,
as well as my own experience working as a software engineer for 10+ years at several startups.

## The birth of Domain Driven Design

Product managers write PRDs in Linear.
Designers turn ideas into Figma designs,
brought to life by engineers.
Marketing spins campaigns in Hubspot.
Customer support talks to customers in Intercom.

How do we make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding our product?
That design and implementation reflect the user's (and our own) mental model?
That everyone from CEO to support uses the same language as the UI and our users?

It's all about communication—and communication is hard.

There's no silver bullet, no magical framework or standard tool.
Instead, we get a parade of competing methodologies, each championed by a different group.

One day, a PM showed up with _Jobs to be Done_.
Designers waved a _Design Thinking_ handbook.
The CEO was still preaching _Lean Startup_.

Then engineers said, "Hold up—let's get practical."
And that's how Domain Driven Design (DDD) was born.

DDD is an engineering-driven approach to improve communication among stakeholders.
It's also a set of software architecture patterns, but that's not what I'm talking about today.

To me, DDD is about bridging the gap between design and engineering. How?

Shared domain understanding.

## Start with business strategy

A great starting point is to nail down your business domain and its subdomains.

The **business domain** is your main gig.
Think FedEx → courier delivery; Starbucks → coffee shops; Walmart → retail.

Seems obvious, right? But ask your team what the business really does, and you might get wildly different answers.
If you’re not aligned on this, congrats—you’ve got bigger problems than just scattered domain knowledge.

Let’s use [Alvin](https://alvin.ai), where I work, as an example to illustrate.
Alvin is in the business of "data warehouse automation"—we digest metadata of data warehouses and help customers with cost and data quality issues, as automatically as possible.

### Breaking your business into subdomains

Now that we know the main business domain, let's zoom in.
**Subdomains** break the business down into finer-grained areas of activity. They come in three flavors:

- **Core Subdomains:** Your secret sauce, the stuff that makes your business special. Expensive to replace and central to your strategy.

  Here are two areas that make Alvin unique: our own query log parsing—something we do better than anyone else—and turning raw data into actionable recommendations.
  We make sure that these systems are rock-solid and scalable.

- **Supporting Subdomains:** Necessary but not game-changing. Think basic CRUD systems. Ideally, you’ll simplify or outsource these over time, turning them into generic subdomains.

  For Alvin, this includes user management. We use Google OAuth for authentication but manage roles and permissions internally.
  The product wouldn't work without it, but no customer will decide for or against Alvin because of it.

- **Generic Subdomains:** Important but standard. Don’t reinvent the wheel—plug in battle-tested third-party solutions here.

  Alvin uses [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io/) for feature flags. Feature flags are a crucial tool for controlled releases and trunk-based development,
  but building it ourselves would be a waste of time.

How do you know which is which? Ask yourself:

- Would someone pay for this on its own? → Core Subdomain
- Would it be cheaper and easier to hack your own implementation, rather than integrating an external one? → Supporting Subdomain

Keep in mind that not all subdomains need to involve your own systems. Some might run on manual processes or third-party services.

Once you have a set of subdomains, try breaking them down further.
Stop when you hit coherent sets of use cases operating on the same data.
Go any deeper, and you’re just adding complexity for no good reason.

## Ubiquitous Language

Having a good overall grasp of what your business does,
now it’s time to get everyone speaking the same language. Enter Ubiquitous Language.

Traditional software development lifecycles work like a giant game of telephone:
Domain knowledge → analysis model → requirements → system design → source code.
Every step introduces noise, misunderstandings, and wasted effort.

Ubiquitous Language flips the script.
Instead of top-down "translations", it emerges through discovery—a collaborative process involving all stakeholders:
management, support, engineers, designers, even users.
No single group owns the language; it’s built together and used by everyone, hence "ubiquitous".

A Ubiquitous Language is the common language of the business, the language of the user—and also the language of the code.

### Creating a Ubiquitous Language

Just start writing or drawing in whatever tool you have at hand—but choose one that is accessible by everyone involved.

Ditch the technical jargon, any ambiguous or synonymous terms, and implicit assumptions.
Aim for clarity, precision, and consistency.

Inconsistent terminology is a common source of confusion. Here’s an example to illustrate:

Consider the term _organization_.
In the context of a multi-tenant system, what do you call the entity that data and users belong to?
Apart from _tenant_ (not a very user-friendly word), there are a myriad of words I've seen used to name this: _organization_ (sometimes abbreviated _org_), _account_, _company_, _team_, _workspace_.
Sometimes you find two of them in the same codebase, the UI using a third one!

While designing your systems, for every concept pick just one term that resonates with your users and your team—and use it consistently across the product and codebase.

Keep in mind that "ubiquitous" does _not_ mean "universal"—there can be multiple languages for different parts of your business.
Words can mean different things in different contexts.

## Bounded contexts

If you try to fit everything into one model, it'll either get bloated or too abstract, killing clarity.

But it's natural that words have different meanings in different contexts.

Take the word “bank.”
In a financial context, it’s where you store money.
In a geographical context, it’s the edge of a river.
In aviation, it’s the tilt of an airplane during a turn.
The term "bank" isn’t universally unique, but within a specific context, it has a precise, agreed-upon meaning.

Similarly, you can separate your business into multiple _bounded contexts_—clearly defined scopes where the language and model apply.

### Designing bounded contexts

While subdomains are discovered, bounded contexts are designed.
This process involves deliberate decisions about what makes sense for your organization.

You can start from the subdomains you identified earlier. But you may find that you need to go more granular or combine multiple subdomains into one context.
For instance, for some teams it might make sense to split a “billing” subdomain into “subscription management” and “payment processing,” another team might merge it into one “invoicing" context.

Bounded contexts also map neatly to implementation and ownership.
In an ideal setup, one team is responsible for each context and managing its delineated part of the system.

In a future article I will show you another fun method to design bounded contexts, EventStorming.

## Conclusion

Domain Driven Design isn’t just about system architecture—it’s about creating a shared understanding across your entire team.
From identifying subdomains to building a ubiquitous language,
DDD helps align stakeholders and ensures your product reflects the real-world needs of its users.

Once you recognize that software development is, at its core, a communication exercise,
frameworks like DDD start to feel less like overhead and more like a lifeline.
It won’t solve every problem, but it can make the journey a little smoother—and maybe even a little fun.
