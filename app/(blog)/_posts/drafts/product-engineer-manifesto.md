Welcome to “The Product Engineer’s Manifesto,” where I compile pearls of wisdom for engineers who are looking to sprinkle a little more product magic into their technical wizardry.

Engineering things that nobody needs is a waste of everyone's time and money – we all ought to think deeply about what we are building and why. I strongly believe that good engineers are product engineers.

## The Innovator's Dilemma

As engineers, we sometimes face the Innovator’s Dilemma—a fancy term for that awkward moment when sticking to what you’re good at might actually be your downfall. Coined by Clayton Christensen, it describes how successful companies can do everything “right” and still lose market leadership because they miss out on groundbreaking innovations. It’s like being the world’s best DVD rental store right before streaming swoops in. The dilemma? Balancing the comfort of the known with the risky business of the new.

Being disruptive isn’t about flipping tables or pulling fire alarms. In the product world, it’s about introducing innovations that shake up the industry and change how things are done. Disruptive products often start off appealing to a niche market or seem inferior to existing solutions but then suddenly become the new standard.

## End-to-end User Journeys

Consider the current project's touchpoints with existing features. Where does the user’s journey start and end?

Avoid building isolated features that appear from nowhere and lead nowhere.

## Use-cases First, Flexibility Follows

Don't set out to solve things generically.

Do start with a few concrete end-to-end use cases.

Do design and implement with future additions in mind–without getting sidetracked.

Over time, essential use cases that require flexibility often become key abstract parts of the system.
Many data-heavy features eventually devolve into highly complex analytical interfaces, with filters, charts, hierarchies and so on.
But if you aim for that from the start, it's easy to get lost in details and over-design and over-engineer something that nobody needs.

## Don’t Guess–Ask and Discover

Challenge assumptions. When it feels like the team starts guessing, someone needs to ask, "how do we know that...?"

Collect the options on the table and go back to do more research–explore designs, conduct user interviews, or consult references.

## Eliminate Problems

Don’t rush to write code as the first solution.

Do consider if the problem can be removed entirely.

If you can eliminate the need for a solution, you save time, reduce complexity, and avoid potential bugs.
Sometimes, the best solution is no solution.

## Embrace Late Abstractions

Don’t abstract too early.

Do let abstractions emerge naturally from concrete implementations.

Premature abstraction can complicate things unnecessarily. Implement solutions first; abstractions will reveal themselves when needed.

## Iterate Quickly

Commit early, push often, share progress, and invite feedback.

Test prototypes with real customers as soon as possible.

Fast iterations help you catch issues sooner and adapt to changes more effectively.

## Document Everything

Don’t leave assumptions and decisions undocumented.

Do meticulously document assumptions, decision-making processes, and thought processes.

Clear documentation captures the reasoning behind decisions, fosters team alignment, and preserves knowledge. By documenting your assumptions and thought processes, you ensure everyone is on the same page and can easily understand the project’s direction. This transparency reduces confusion, facilitates onboarding, and enables the team to build on each other’s work effectively.
