If you’re working on a data-heavy app, you’ve definitely come across a need for filters.
Early versions of your product might squeak by without them—good hierarchies with just a few tabs or a simple search might suffice.
But as your product matures, filters become inevitable.
(Let's be honest, every B2B app eventually becomes a dashboarding solution.)

In this post, I’ll explore the technical challenges of building robust filters and how I’m developing an open-source TypeScript library inspired by Django to simplify the process.

## The Slippery Slope of Filtering

Filtering is one of those features that sneaks up on you.

At first, your app might not need it.
A small dataset is easy to scroll through.
Users are happy with just a paginated table or a list view embedded in a understandable information hierarchy.
Let's say you app has projects and projects have tasks: there might be a list of projects, and when you click on a project, you see its tasks. Easy, right?

But as your product grows, so do the needs for making complex data accessible.
Suddenly, users start asking for more ways to find the data they need for their use case:

- “Can I see just the open issues? From all projects?”
- “How about showing only items updated in the last 7 days?”

Striving to keep your design simple (and implementation work minimal),
you might initially reach for simple solutions: tabs to divide the data into rough categories—open vs. closed issues.
A search bar for free-text queries.
But eventually, you find yourself implementing date range pickers, dropdowns for categories, and dynamic filters tied to user-specific contexts.

Here’s where the slippery slope gets dangerous:

- Ad-hoc implementations: Filters are added one-off for each page instead of designing a reusable filtering mechanism.
- Inconsistent UX: Different pages implement filters differently—some use dropdowns, others use chips, and a few rely on modals.
- Fragmented Logic: Filter logic is scattered across your app, embedded in various components, schemas, or query builders.

What started as a simple table has turned into a patchwork of filtering hacks that’s brittle, hard to maintain, and impossible to scale.
Just one more filter! Just one more condition!

This is where having a generic filtering pattern becomes invaluable.
By abstracting the complexity into a consistent framework, you can avoid the pitfalls of ad-hoc implementations.
Your users will also thank you for a more consistent and predictable experience.

So what do we need to look out for when building a reusable framework?

## The Hidden Complexity of Filters

At first, filters seem straightforward: apply criteria to show a subset of items. But as you build them, complexity creeps in.

### Serialization

Filter queries must be URL-serializable so users can share or bookmark filtered views. Simple cases are easy:

```
/issues?status=open&assignee=john
```

But handling complex queries, like ranges or nested conditions, can quickly become a headache.
How do you encode operators like “greater than” or “between”?
How do you encode multiple values for a single filter like "status is open or closed"?
You might say, let's not build something we don't need yet—but trust me, the day will come, and you'll wish you had a plan.

### Transformation

A serialized filter is useless without translating it into actionable queries. This could mean converting it into:

- Database queries, like a WHERE clause or GraphQL expression
- API parameters for a backend
- Client-side filtering logic, like a function that filters an array of objects according to the filter query

Where do you place this logic? How do you ensure it’s consistent across your app?

### Filter Types and Dynamic Options

Filters need to fit the data and context:

- Date pickers for ranges
- Dropdowns for categorical data with pre-defined options, like "status"
- Free-text inputs for searches

Each type needs tailored UI and definitions for labels, operators, and options.
Often, options must be dynamic—e.g., showing only relevant “Assignees” for a selected project.

## Introducing @dataready/filters

In my many years of building data-intensive UIs, I've found that building filters from scratch can be time-consuming and error-prone.
So I started working on an open-source library that abstracts away the complexity of filters and provides a simple API to build them.

**@dataready/filters** is a TypeScript library designed to handle the heavy lifting of filter logic.
Inspired by Django ORM and django-filter, it provides the tools you need to build robust, flexible filtering systems while leaving the application of filters entirely up to you.

### Key Features

For serialization, I chose a Django-inspired approach with powerful lookup paths (e.g., "age\_\_gt=18").
It's really flexible and works well with native data structures like URLSearchParams.

For evaluation, you define reusable filters that contain the logic to transform the user's filter expressions into whatever your app needs to evaluate the query.
That could be SQL statements, API parameters, or client-side logic.

Finally, we need some help preparing both filters and filter expressions to be rendered and manipulated by the UI—be that a simple form or a complex filter builder.

Also, of course it's fully typed—you'll always know exactly what you're dealing with.

### How It Works

Here’s a typical workflow with @dataready/filters:

1. Define Filters: Create filter objects describing how filter expressions are transformed into logic. Attach UI metadata like labels, operators, and options.
1. Combine Filters: Group multiple filters into a FilterSet to declare which filters are available.
1. Decode Queries: Parse URL query strings into filter expressions.
1. Apply Filters: Transform expressions into logic (e.g., functions, SQL fragments).
1. Evaluate: Apply the logic to your data.
1. UI Integration: Display and interact with filters in your frontend.

### Example: Evaluating Filters

```ts
import { createFilter, createFilterSet, decodeQuery } from "@dataready/filter";

type MyObj = { age: number };
const obj: MyObj = { age: 25 };

// Define a filter
const age = createFilter({
  match({ lookup }) {
    // Lookups support complex paths but here we just check the first part
    return lookup.path.at(0) === "age";
  },
  transform({ lookup, value }) {
    // In this example, we transform filter expressions into runtime filter functions
    if (lookup.operator.name === "lt") {
      return (obj: MyObj) => obj.age < Number(value);
    }
    if (lookup.operator.name === "gt") {
      return (obj: MyObj) => obj.age > Number(value);
    }
    throw new Error("unsupported lookup expression");
  },
});

// Define a filter set
const filterSet = createFilterSet([age]);

// Evaluate a query
const query = decodeQuery("age__lt=30&age__gt=20");
const appliedFilters = filterSet(query);

// Apply all the filter functions
const matches = appliedFilters.map(({ result }) => result(obj));
const isMatch = matches.every(Boolean);
console.log(isMatch); // true
```

## Conclusion

@dataready/filters bridges the gap between filter definition, query serialization, and UI integration. By focusing on reusable logic and flexibility, it provides the foundation for robust filtering systems while leaving application-specific decisions up to you.
