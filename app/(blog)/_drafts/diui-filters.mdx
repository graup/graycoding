If you’ve ever worked on a data-heavy app, you’ve likely encountered the need for filters.
Early versions of your product might manage without them—good hierarchical structuring of information might suffice.
But as your product matures, users demand ways to access data exactly how they want, and filtering is often one of the solutions.

This is especially true in enterprise software, where—let's be honest—our apps are constantly at risk of becoming a glorified dashboard.
It’s not what we set out to build, and it’s not what customers truly need (they could've just stuck with Excel).
But we have to embrace filters as part of the reality of making data accessible, while remembering they can’t fix a flawed information architecture or salvage ill-conceived features.

In this post, I’ll explore the technical challenges of building robust filters and how I’m developing an open-source TypeScript library inspired by Django to simplify the process.

## The Slippery Slope of Filtering

Filtering is one of those features that sneaks up on you.

At first, your app might not need it.
A small dataset is easy to scroll through.
Users are happy with just a paginated table or a list view embedded in a understandable information hierarchy.
Let's say your app has projects and projects have tasks: there might be a list of projects, and when you click on a project, you see its tasks. Easy, right?

But as your product grows, so do the needs for making complex data accessible.
Suddenly, users start asking for more ways to find the data they need for their use case:

- “Can I see just the open issues? From all projects?”
- “How about showing only items updated in the last 7 days?”

Striving to keep your design simple (and implementation work minimal),
you might initially reach for lightweight solutions: tabs to divide the data into rough categories (open vs. closed issues),
a search bar for free-text queries.
But eventually, you find yourself implementing date range pickers, dropdowns for categories, and dynamic filters tied to user-specific contexts.

Here’s where the slippery slope gets dangerous:

- Ad-hoc implementations: Filters are added one-off for each page instead of designing a reusable filtering mechanism.
- Fragmented Logic: Filter logic is scattered across your app, embedded in various components, schemas, and query builders.
- Inconsistent UX: Different pages implement filters differently—some use dropdowns, others use chips, and a few rely on modals.

What started as a simple table has turned into a patchwork of filtering hacks that’s brittle, hard to maintain, and impossible to scale.
Just one more filter! Just one more condition!

This is where having a generic filtering pattern becomes invaluable.
By abstracting the complexity into a consistent framework, you can avoid the pitfalls of ad-hoc implementations.
Your users will also thank you for a more consistent and predictable experience.

So what do we need to look out for when building a reusable framework?

## Hidden Complexity of Filters

From far away, filters seem straightforward: apply criteria to gather a subset of items. But as you build them, complexity creeps in.

### Serialization

Filter queries must be URL-serializable so users can share or bookmark filtered views. Simple cases are easy:

```
/issues?status=open&assignee=john
```

But handling complex queries, like ranges or nested conditions, can quickly become a headache.
How do you encode conditions like “greater than” or “between”?
How do you encode multiple values for a single filter like "status is open or closed"?
You might say, let's not build something we don't need yet—but I've been there, changing the serialization format later is a pain.

### Transformation

So we can decode a serialized filter query like "status=open&assignee=john" into an object representation,
but it is useless without translating it into something that can act on our data.
This could mean converting it into:

- Database queries, like a WHERE clause or GraphQL expression
  ```sql
  WHERE status = "open" AND assignee = "john"
  ```
- Runtime filtering logic, like a function that filters an array of objects according to the filter query
  ```ts
  const filterFn = (item) => item.status === "open" && item.assignee === "john";
  const filteredItems = items.filter(filterFn);
  ```
- Any other way imaginable, like passing the filter query to an API or a third-party service

Where do you place this logic? How do you ensure it’s consistent across your app?

### Metadata: Types and Dynamic Options

When you display filters in the UI, typically you need more than just the filter name.

Filters might have labels and be displayed using different form elements. Filters need to fit the data and context:

- Date pickers for ranges
- Dropdowns for categorical data with pre-defined options, like "status"
- Checkboxes for simple on/off filters
- Free-text inputs for searches

Often, options must be dynamic—e.g., showing only relevant “Assignees” for a selected project.
Ideally you want to encode this metadata in your filter definitions to ensure consistency across your app.

## Introducing @dataready/filters

In my many years of building data-intensive UIs, I've found that building filters from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone.
Like I said earlier, you cannot avoid them—but you also cannot justify spending too much time on them early on.
So I started working on an open-source library that abstracts away the complexity of filters and provides a simple API to build them.

**@dataready/filters** is a TypeScript library designed to handle the heavy lifting of filter logic in JavaScript-based frontend and backend applications.
Inspired by Django ORM and django-filter, it provides the tools you need to build robust, flexible filtering systems while leaving the execution of filters entirely up to you.

### Key Features

For serialization, I chose a Django-inspired approach with powerful lookup paths with support for field paths, operators, and negation (e.g., "age\_\_gt=18" or "status\_\_not=open").
It's really flexible and works well with native data structures like URLSearchParams.

For evaluation, you define reusable filters that contain the logic to transform the user's filter expressions into whatever your app needs to evaluate the query.
That could be SQL statements, API parameters, or client-side logic.

Finally, we need some help preparing both filters and filter expressions to be rendered and manipulated by the UI—be that a simple form or a complex filter builder.

Also, of course we want it to be typesafe—you'll always know exactly what you're dealing with.

### How It Works

Here’s a typical workflow with @dataready/filters:

1. Define Filters: Create filter objects describing how filter expressions are transformed into logic. Attach UI metadata like labels, operators, and options.
1. Combine Filters: Group multiple filters into a FilterSet to declare which filters are available.
1. Decode Queries: Parse URL query strings into filter expressions.
1. Apply Filters: Transform expressions into logic (e.g., functions, SQL fragments).
1. Evaluate: Apply the logic to your data.
1. UI Integration: Display and interact with filters in your frontend.

### Example: Evaluating Filters

```ts
import { createFilter, createFilterSet, decodeQuery } from "@dataready/filter";

type MyObj = { age: number };
const obj: MyObj = { age: 25 };

// Define a filter
const age = createFilter({
  match({ lookup }) {
    // Lookups support complex paths but here we just check the first part
    return lookup.path.at(0) === "age";
  },
  transform({ lookup, value }) {
    // In this example, we transform filter expressions into runtime filter functions
    if (lookup.operator.name === "lt") {
      return (obj: MyObj) => obj.age < Number(value);
    }
    if (lookup.operator.name === "gt") {
      return (obj: MyObj) => obj.age > Number(value);
    }
    throw new Error("unsupported lookup expression");
  },
});

// Define a filter set
const filterSet = createFilterSet([age]);

// Evaluate a query
const query = decodeQuery("age__lt=30&age__gt=20");
const appliedFilters = filterSet(query);

// Apply all the filter functions
const matches = appliedFilters.map(({ result }) => result(obj));
const isMatch = matches.every(Boolean);
console.log(isMatch); // true
```

## Conclusion

@dataready/filters bridges the gap between filter definition, query serialization, and UI integration.
By focusing on reusable logic and flexibility, it provides the foundation for robust filtering systems while leaving application-specific decisions up to you.
