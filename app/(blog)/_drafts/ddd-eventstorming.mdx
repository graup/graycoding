## EventStorming

Despite its "product-y" looking spelling, EventStorming is just a low-tech, high-impact group activity
designed to uncover and share domain knowledge. Think sticky notes, whiteboards, and lots of collaboration.

Ideally you do this in person. But if your team is remote, tools like Excalidraw or Miro can work as well.

I like to kick off an EventStorming session as soon as we've identified the subdomain we are tackling and its key features.
Consider this part of the design process for major features or new products.
This could be owned by a PM, designer, or engineer.
Given its rather technical nature, engineers often lead, but involving other perspectives is a must.

The goal is twofold:

1. a visual representation of the domain model which can be used for the next steps.
2. (more importantly) a shared understanding of the domain across the team.

Here are the elements you can add to the board, in this order:

1. Unstructured Exploration: brainstorming of domain events (in past tense). Orange sticky notes
2. Timelines: sequence events, starting with the “happy path”, then add alternative scenarios.
3. Pain Points: bottlenecks, manual steps that require automation, or missing domain knowledge. Rotated pink sticky notes
4. Pivotal Events: major business events indicating a change in context or phase. Mark with vertical bars
5. Commands: actions that trigger events or flows. Blue sticky notes
6. Policies: automated commands triggered by specific events. Purple sticky notes
7. Read Models: data views that actors use to decide on commands. Green sticky notes.
8. External Systems: dependencies outside your domain. Pink sticky notes.
9. Aggregates: clusters of domain objects with consistent state. Draw large boxes with marker.
10. Bounded Contexts: map out where specific language and models apply. The largest boxes.

You can take breaks or stop at any point, but the more detail you discover, the better.
