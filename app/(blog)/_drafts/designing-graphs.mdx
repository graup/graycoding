Thoughts about graphs

Graphs are one of my favorite data structures ever.

They are a beautiful representation of many complex real world processes.
Cooking recipes, assembly instructions, and software dependencies
can all be described as a series of steps that need to be taken in a specific order.
This order is not just linear (step 1, step 2, step 3), but has inter-dependencies (step 3 follows 1 and 2; or both step 2 and 3 follows 1).

Such graphs are almost always "directed", i.e. there is a temporal or logical sequence to the steps.
In technical systems, sometimes directed graphs can be constrained to be acyclical, then called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

But in the real world most graphs aren't acyclical. Flows of data, maps of complex tasks, and how people learn often have iterative components.
You do step 1, 2, 3... and then step 1 again! This also happens in electronics, where a signal can be fed back into the system,
creating a complex system that can have a stable equilibrium or osciliate over time.
