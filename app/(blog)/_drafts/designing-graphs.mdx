Graphs are one of my favorite data structures everâ€”both on a technical and a visual level.

They are a powerful representation of many complex real world processes.
Cooking recipes[^1], assembly instructions, and software dependencies
can all be described as a series of steps that need to be taken in a specific order.
This order is not just a linear list, but has inter-dependencies.

(viz of step1 -> step 2 -> step 3 and then viz of something more complex)

[^1]:
    For example, in this paper by my colleagues at KAIST:
    [RecipeScape: An Interactive Tool for Analyzing Cooking Instructions at Scale](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174025)

Real-world graphs are almost always _directed_, i.e. there is a temporal or logical sequence to the steps (step 1 has to be done before step 2),
or some kind of relationship between them (like connections in your social graph).

In technical systems, sometimes directed graphs can be constrained to be acyclical, then called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
But in the real world most graphs aren't acyclical. Flows of data, maps of complex tasks, and how people learn often have iterative components.
You do step 1, 2, 3... and then step 1 again! This also happens in electronics, where a signal can be fed back into the system,
creating a complex system that can have a stable equilibrium or osciliate over time.

graph UI problems

big graphs are difficult to lay out and navigate
in fact, graphs are most useful when they are of medium size and complexity:
too simple, and they could be represented as a list or table; too complex, and they become unreadable.
so we need to pick the right level of abstraction for the task at hand.

zooming out

pagination

filtering graph data
ill-defined.. you need to think about what this means.
maybe compression is a better way to look at it

searching
