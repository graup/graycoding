Product managers write Google docs.
Designers draw in Figma.
Engineers create diagrams and code.
Marketing creates campaigns in Hubspot.
Customer support writes in Zendesk.
How do we make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding our product?
That the design and implementation reflect the user's mental model?
That everyone from CEO to support uses the same language as the UI and our users?

Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a methodology pioneered by engineers to improve communication among stakeholders.
It also is a set of software architecture patterns, but that's not what I'm talking about here.
I see it first and foremost as a way to bridge the gap between design and engineering.

How does it work?

It's all about a shared domain understanding.

## Start with business strategy

A good exercise you can start with is to define the business domain and subdomains.
Subdomains can be useful to organize your team and architecture around.

- **Business Domain**: main area of activity
  - FedEx: courier delivery; Starbucks: coffee shops; Walmart: retail
  - This may be obvious to you but different people on your team may have different ideas about what the business does.
- **Subdomain**: fine-grained area of business activity. what are all the parts that make up the business?
  - Core subdomains: differentiators, high cost of switching, competitive advantage, strategy, secret sauce.
  - Generic subdomains: important parts but possible to use battle-tested generic implementations instead of building your own.
  - Supporting subdomains: non-generic, but also no competitive advantage; e.g. simple CRUD parts. Ideally can be turned into generic subdomains.
  - The focus of business efforts should be on core subdomains.
  - Subdomains don’t always need to involve your own technical systems. It can also be a manual process or a third-party service.
  - How to differentiate
    - Would someone pay for it on its own? → Core subdomain
    - Would it be simpler and cheaper to hack your own implementation, rather than integrating an external one? → Supporting subdomain

  - When to stop decomposing subdomains into smaller parts?
    - Identify sets of coherent use cases that operate on the same data

## Ubiquitous Language

Traditional software development lifecycle implies top-down _translations_
(domain knowledge → analysis model → requirements → system design → source code)

A Ubiquitous Language is instead defined through _discovery_ among domain experts.
Domain experts here really are all stakeholders of your business in any way related to your product.
That can include management, support, engineers, designers, users, and others.
It is crucial that not any one group defines the language on their own.

The Ubiquitous Language is the common language of the business, the language of the user – and also the language of the code.

Try to avoid technical jargon, ambiguous or synonymous terms, implicit assumptions, and extraneous details.
Use whatever tool you have at hand to document the language but choose one that is accessible by everyone involved.

Keep in mind that "ubiquitous" language does _not_ mean "universal".

Don't try to make one model fit everything. It will be ineffective.
Don't make it work by making terms more complex. It will increase cognitive load and make it more difficult to align implementation with the ubiquitous language.

It's okay for different domain experts to different models of the same business domain.
The model boundaries are called _bounded contexts_ in DDD.
While subdomains are discovered, **bounded contexts are designed.**
That means a conscious decision depending on what makes sense for the organization.
They also often translate naturally into implementation scopes and ownership (e.g. one team per bounded context).

## EventStorming

Despite its "product-y" looking spelling, EventStorming is just a low-tech, high-touch group activity with the aim of discovering and sharing domain knowledge.

Ideally you do this in person with a whiteboard and sticky notes. But for remote teams, tools like Excalidraw or Miro can work as well.

**Here is an Excalidraw template I created. Feel free to use it for your sessions.**

I like having an EventStorming session as soon as the overall subdomain we are working on and its main features becomes clear.

The outcome of a session is on the one hand a visual representation of the domain model,
but maybe more importantly, it is a shared understanding of the domain among all stakeholders.

Here are the elements you can add to the board:

1. Unstructured Exploration: brainstorming of domain events (described in past tense). Orange sticky notes
2. Timelines: organize events in order, starting with “happy path”, then adding alternative scenarios
3. Pain Points: identify bottlenecks, manual steps that require automation, missing documentation, or missing domain knowledge. Rotated pink sticky notes
4. Pivotal Events: identify significant business events indicating a change in context or phase. Mark with vertical bar
5. Commands: describe what triggered the event or flow of events. Blue sticky notes
6. Policies: when commands are automatically executed when a specific domain event occurs. Purple sticky notes
7. Read Models: the view of data within the domain that the actor uses to make a decision to execute a command. Green sticky notes.
8. External Systems: Pink sticky notes.
9. Aggregates
10. Bounded Contexts

## Evolving Design Decisions

> As an organization grows and evolves, it’s not unusual for some of its subdomains to morph from one type to another.

> As time goes by, documentation often becomes stale, people who were working on the original design leave the company,
> and new functionality is added in an ad hoc manner until, at one point, the codebase gains the dubious status of a legacy system.
> **It’s vital to prevent such degradation of domain knowledge proactively.**

Here are some heuristics to help with that:

- When a subdomain’s functionality is expanded, try to identify more finer-grained subdomain boundaries that will enable you to make better design decisions.
- Don’t allow a bounded context to become a “jack of all trades.” Make sure the models encompassed by bounded contexts are focused to solve specific problems.
- Make sure your aggregates’ boundaries are as small as possible. Use the heuristic of strongly consistent data to detect possibilities to extract business logic into new aggregates.
