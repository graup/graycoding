As a teenager growing up in Berlin, I was fascinated by the idea of living in a different country.
My cousin was studying in Beijing at the time, and I remember being captivated by his stories of life in a foreign land.

But I never imagined how seemingly small choices, saying yes to random opportunities, would lead me to live and
work in South Korea for almost a decade.
And now, in my 30s, I’m settling down in Estonia—an opportunity that was similarily serendipitous but made with a bit more calculation.

Reflecting on my journey, I’ve realized that all these life choices have a curious connection to a concept from finance: arbitrage.

## Arbitrage Beyond Finance

In finance, arbitrage is when an investor capitalizes on price differences in different markets to make a profit without taking any risk.
It’s about recognizing and exploiting imbalances to one’s advantage.

For example, for some time in 2018, the price of Bitcoin in South Korea was around 50% higher than in the US.
If you could simultaneously buy Bitcoin in the US and sell it in Korea, you could make a risk-free profit.[^1]

    If you then also had a way to transfer Korean Won cash back to your account abroad, you could have repeated this process indefinitely.
    Unfortunately, South Korean capital controls put a limit to this.

But financial markets aren’t the only places where arbitrage can happen.

In our globalized world, countries and even cities within a country compete with each other to attract financial and human capital.
Different places have different advantages in terms of cost of living, quality of life, career opportunities, and so on.
People can, and increasingly do, vote with their feet[^2] for the best place to live or do business.

[^2]:
    Voting with your feet is also a core idea behind [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/), a movement lead by Balaji Srinivasan that
    envisions a world where people choose their governance like they choose their internet service provider.

**Where in the world does the “value” (income, safety, quality of life etc.) you receive maximally exceed the “cost” you invest (monetary or emotional)?**
If we think about out life choices like this, we're thinking like arbitrageurs.
This choice can be temporary, like choosing to study abroad, or more permanent, like choosing a place to settle down and start a family.
And, obviously, what you value most will change over the course of your live.

## Studying and Exploring in Your Early Years

Since my childhood I’ve had a huge interest in East Asia thanks to anime and video games.
I was a huge Pokémon fan. In 2004, my uncle brought me a CoroCoro magaine from Tokyo.
At the time, before having immediate access to all the world's news on the internet, it was a rare window to another world.
I studied the printed screenshots of upcoming Pokémon games and was dazzled by the magazine’s aesthetics.

After finishing highschool, my cousin invited me on a trip to Korea. I knew next to nothing about the country but I said yes.
It was an amazing trip, and afterwards I thought it would be a great idea to study there.

Compared to your later choices in life, studying abroad is really easy. You just have to go for it and apply.
From there on, most pratical matters are taken care of for you, like accomodation, visa, and schedules.
I would recommend everyone to take advantage of this opportunity—it’s way harder to move countries later by yourself.

Leaving your cultural background behind can be incredibly freeing.
It’s great to be outside of the confines of things at home.
Both your family and society as a whole has influenced how you live your whole life, in many ways both subtle and direct.
But far away from that, you can dare to be a bit weird, do things a bit differently.
You soak in bits of the local culture.
But most importantly, you learn to be yourself.

In choosing to study in South Korea, I unknowingly engaged in educational arbitrage.
I accessed a world-class education, immersed myself in a vibrant culture and cutting-edge technology,
and gained unique experiences that enriched my personal and professional life.
The disparities between my home country and Korea presented opportunities I gained a lot from.

## Working and Professional Growth

After graduating, it's time to decide where to start your career.
For me it was an easy choice to stay in Korea. By now I had learned the language and made some connections.
Local businesses would also appreciate my degree from a Korean university more than elsewhere.

I felt like I had a good chance to get a job here–I felt "unique" in a way.
When you're away from home, it's way easier to feel that way.
There weren't (and probably still aren't) many frontend developers from Germany with a degree from KAIST who can speak Korean.

So I used my uniqueness to my advatange and got a job at a small startup using a hot new technology, blockchain.[^3]

[^3]: Yes, in 2016 blockchain was still hot and new. I still believe the technology has its merits but I'm still waiting for the killer app.

This was professional arbitrage in action.
By staying in South Korea, I tapped into a up and coming tech scene.
The ‘market’ in Korea valued my unique skill set more than perhaps in Germany, allowing me to pick my job, accelerate my career, and work on cutting-edge technology.
By working for a small company rather than a big conglomerate, I had more responsibility and could grow faster.

## Settling Down

I had been living in Korea for eight years when I met my wife.
We both were ready to move on for many reasons.

A big one was that both of our families are really far away from Korea.
We wanted to be closer to them, especially now that we were thinking about starting our family.

Also, despite all its advantages, Korea can be a tough place to live. Even speaking Korean fairly fluently, I still felt like an outsider.
Foreigners don't benefit from the same social safety nets and government supports as Koreans do.
In Germany, every resident can receive 250 euro per month per child and free kindergarten.
In Korea, you get nothing if the child doesn't have Korean citizenship.

Salaries in Korea are not bad, but the cost of living is not low either, especially in Seoul.

So we were looking for a place that offered a high quality of life and a supportive environment for starting a family.
And of course I didn't want to leave all opportunities in technology and innovation behind.

Somehow we ended up in Estonia. Again it was a random opportunity that brought us here.

I got a remote job offer from a company in Tallinn. They invited us to visit and we both fell in love with the city.
Estonia is known for its advanced digital infrastructure, progressive policies, and vibrant startup scene.
It also offers a lower cost of living compared to many Western European countries, along with excellent public services.

By moving to Estonia, I engaged in lifestyle arbitrage.
This time, the ‘value’ we were looking for was quality of life, economic opportunities, and societal benefits.
The favorable tax environment, coupled with a strong tech ecosystem, provided an ideal setting for both personal and professional fulfillment.

## Elements of Arbitrage

In finance, arbitrage involves three key elements:

1. Identifying Discrepancies: Spotting a price difference for the same asset in different markets.
2. Swift Action: Acting quickly before the market corrects itself.
3. Risk-Free Profit: Earning a profit without additional risk or investment.

Translating this to life decisions, it becomes about:

1. Recognizing Opportunities: Finding places where your goals and needs are better met.
2. Embracing Change: Being willing to make a move or take action when the opportunity arises.
3. Maximizing Benefit: Enhancing your quality of life without disproportionate sacrifice.

So how can you harness the concept of arbitrage in your own life decisions?

1. Identify Your Priorities:

   - Career Opportunities: Are you seeking advancement, higher salaries, or entry into a specific industry?
   - Lifestyle Preferences: Do you prioritize a bustling city life or a peaceful rural setting? What about climate preferences?
   - Financial Goals: Are you aiming to save money, reduce debt, or invest in property?

2. Research and Recognize Opportunities:

   - Look for places that offer advantages aligned with your goals.

3. Assess Costs and Benefits:

   - Weigh the potential gains against the sacrifices required.
   - Benefits: Higher savings rate, improved quality of life, better work-life balance.
   - Challenges: Cultural adjustments, language barriers, distance from family and friends.

4. Be Prepared to Act:

   - Opportunities may be time-sensitive; readiness is key.

5. Embrace Serendipity:
   - Often, opportunities come unexpectedly. Be prepared to embrace them even if they weren’t part of your original plan.

## Final Thoughts

Arbitrage teaches us to look beyond the obvious and seek value where others might not see it. By applying this mindset to life, we can proactively find places and situations that align with our evolving goals and needs.

Whether you’re a recent graduate eager to explore, a professional seeking new horizons, or someone looking to settle down, considering the principles of arbitrage can lead to more informed and rewarding life choices.

Remember, the world is vast, and opportunities abound for those willing to seek them out. By understanding and applying arbitrage beyond finance, you might just find your next great adventure—or the perfect place to call home.

So, are you ready to embark on your own journey of life arbitrage? The possibilities are endless, and the rewards can be beyond your expectations.

A software developer from San Francisco, where living costs are exorbitant, might move to Austin or even abroad to Tallinn, maintaining a similar salary but significantly reducing expenses. The result is increased savings and disposable income—a direct “profit” from life arbitrage.

Someone tired of long, harsh winters might move from a cold climate to a tropical locale, gaining more sunshine and outdoor opportunities, which can boost happiness and health.

An aspiring artist might move to Berlin to immerse themselves in its renowned art scene, accessing networks and inspiration that aren’t available in their hometown.

### Discovering New Problems and Inspirations

Another powerful aspect of life arbitrage is the exposure to new environments, which can inspire innovation and uncover unique problems worth solving.
Traveling and living in different places broaden your perspective, challenge your assumptions, and ignite creativity.

### Fueling Innovation Through Exposure

    •	New Perspectives: Immersing yourself in different cultures and societies exposes you to diverse ways of thinking and living. This can lead to fresh ideas and approaches that you might not encounter in your familiar environment.
    •	Identifying Unmet Needs: By experiencing different markets and communities, you may notice gaps or inefficiencies that present opportunities for innovation.
    •	Building a Global Network: Living abroad allows you to connect with people from various backgrounds, expanding your professional network and opening doors to collaborations.

### Startups and Global Inspiration

Many entrepreneurs and startup founders attribute their innovative ideas to experiences gained while traveling or living abroad.

    •	Example: The founders of Airbnb were inspired to create their platform after struggling to find affordable accommodations while traveling. Their personal experiences highlighted a gap in the market, leading to a groundbreaking business idea.
    •	Case Study: Spotify, founded in Sweden, emerged from a keen understanding of the global issues surrounding music piracy and the lack of accessible streaming services. Exposure to these challenges firsthand allowed the founders to develop a solution with worldwide impact.

By applying the concept of arbitrage to where you live and work, you position yourself at the intersection of different cultures, markets, and ideas. This can be a fertile ground for creativity and entrepreneurial endeavors.
